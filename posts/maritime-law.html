    <h1>Understanding Florida Maritime Laws</h1>
    

    <main>
        <section>
            <p>Florida has over 1,000 miles of coastline, filled with busy ports and a thriving marine recreation industry. Our state's maritime industry is governed by the laws and regulations of multiple jurisdications. Consequently, the laws applying to specific locations and circumstances and are governed by overlapping legislative bodies — whether local, state, national, or international. These laws and regulations are designed to keep people and vessels safe, protect marine ecosystems, and regulate both commercial and recreational activities on the water.</p>

            <p>Maritime law is very complicated, and understanding it is important for vessel operators and all maritime professionals to ensure compliance and safety while avoiding potential legal issues. When an incident arises, it’s essential to work with legal professionals experienced in maritime law. Working with an attorney who isn’t familiar with this specific and complex legislative corpus can lead to missed opportunities and sub-optimal outcomes.</p>

            <p>Take a look at this brief overview of a highly complex and dynamic area of law.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Jurisdictional Framework</h2>
            <p>The jurisdictional framework of Florida maritime laws can be summed up in one word: complicated. Navigating the legal landscape, much like navigating the waters the laws apply to, requires a thorough understanding of the framework. Things that are fairly straightforward on land, like the division between federal and state authority, aren’t so simple on the water and include additional complications stemming from international areas of governance. Even working on a seemingly uncomplicated local case requires a working understanding of federal and state laws and regulations.</p>

            <p>This section will dig into the intersection of federal and state jurisdictions, outline how it’s determined which umbrella a situation falls under, and touch on the international implications of our state’s maritime laws.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Federal vs. State Maritime Jurisdiction</h2>
            <p>Maritime law is also known as admiralty law, and it’s mostly governed by federal statutes and international treaties. That said, states like Florida, which have a robust maritime economy, also have specific regulations that address the unique elements of this state. These laws are designed to work alongside federal and international regulations. Trying to understand the distinction between federal and state regulations can be complicated in Florida, and a lot of it really depends on the location and the specific type of maritime activity you are engaging in. Federal jurisdiction is most often applicable in navigable waters that are used for either national or international industry, while state jurisdiction is often applied to non-commercially navigable waters or activities that don’t leave the state boundaries, like recreational boating.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>International Implications on Florida’s Maritime Laws</h2>
            <p>Florida is a key state in the cruise industry and countless other maritime commercial industries like shipping, so even in-state operations often must account for international maritime laws and conventions. Regulations from the International Maritime Organization and treaties such as the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea are highly relevant and either directly tie into local laws or were instrumental in writing the laws, especially those that apply to environmental protection, safety standards, and shipping guidelines.</p>

            <p>With legal issues involving cruise ships, there can be a lot of confusion about whether state and federal laws apply or whether the situation falls under international law, and oftentimes, the situation is a complex blend of “all of the above.” Cruise companies leverage this complexity as an additional insulator against victims who may have legal recourse following an injury on a cruise, but this is just another reason why it’s so important to work with an experienced attorney for any maritime-related legal issue.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Regulatory Bodies</h2>
            <p>There are a number of key regulatory bodies that oversee and enforce maritime activities in Florida. These bodies make sure that maritime law is upheld, safety standards are met, and environmental protections are respected and adhered to. Federal entities like the United States Coast Guard, as well as local chapters of state organizations like the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, each play an instrumental role in a widely coordinated effort to protect individuals and maintain order.</p>

            <p>The following section will give you a general overview of a few of the most important regulatory bodies, although it’s important to recognize that there are many other regulatory bodies, commissions, and organizations that each contribute to the regulatory landscape and ensure that the relevant laws are current and effective.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>United States Coast Guard (USCG)</h3>
            <p>The United States Coast Guard is the primary enforcement agency when it comes to maritime law. In Florida, the Coast Guard is responsible for a lot of different activities and key elements of maritime activities, including vessel inspections, drug enforcement, search and rescue missions, and environmental protection.</p>

            <p>As a branch of the Armed Forces, the Coast Guard is well-funded and resourced to address the many responsibilities that fall under its scope. Coast Guard sailors are well-trained and highly professional, and their work is instrumental in keeping our waterways safe.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC)</h3>
            <p>The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, more often referred to as the FWC, is charged with managing and protecting Florida’s fish and wildlife resources by regulating fishing, enforcing recreational boating safety laws, and managing a multitude of conservation programs in the state. The FWC is a key player in the effort to keep our state’s marine ecosystems healthy, ensuring that recreational boating is safe and keeping our robust natural resources accessible to all.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)</h3>
            <p>The Florida Department of Environmental Protection is, as the name suggests, in charge of protecting Florida’s natural resources, which includes its many waterways. The DEP operates our many state parks, enforces environmental laws, and issues permits for activities that impact the environment.</p>

            <p>The DEP and FWC have a lot of overlap in their goals, which is true for all of the relevant regulatory bodies that work to keep our waterways safe and healthy for the enjoyment of all. The DEP, specifically, focuses on preventing pollution, regulating coastal development, and preserving the unique marine habitats that make Florida so unique.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Vessel Registration and Documentation</h2>
            <p>Each motorized vessel, including personal watercraft (PWC) like JetSkis, must be registered like any other vehicle. This is handled by the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV). To get properly registered you’ll need proof of ownership, registration fees, and a valid title. With all of this in order, you can then register your craft to ensure that you are legally allowed to operate on the water, insure your vehicle, and ultimately identify it in the event of an accident or theft.</p>

            <p>If you sell your vessel or want to transfer ownership for any other reason, you’ll need to fill out the transfer section on the back of your title and submit it to the FLHSMV. Once you’ve taken this step, the new owner will need to apply for a new title and registration using all of the required documentation. If you sell to an out-of-state buyer, you should hold onto a copy of the completed title transfer to make sure that you don’t encounter any issues that could hold you liable for the vessel due to miscommunications between states’ licensing and titling agencies.</p>

            <p>If you are operating an out-of-state vessel in Florida waters for more than 90 consecutive days, then you’ll need to register the vessel in Florida. Foreign vessels must also comply with Florida regulations if they are operated in Florida waters for an extended time. If you are an owner or operator of a foreign boat, it’s a good idea to contact the FLHSMV or consult with a maritime attorney to make sure that you are in compliance and avoid any issues.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Penalties for Registration and Documentation Violations</h2>
            <p>If you are not in compliance with the registration or documentation regulations in Florida, you may run into some penalties — either fines or possibly having the vehicle impounded until you remedy the situation. Both the FWC and USCG actively patrol state waters to enforce licensing and registration laws.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Safety Regulations</h2>
            <p>Maritime operations are central to our global economy, but it can be dangerous and unpredictable. The state and federal governments, as well as a number of international regulatory bodies, have implemented and continuously expound upon strict safety regulations designed to protect boaters as well as the marine environment they operate in. The US Coast Guard and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission are just two of the many agencies tasked with enforcing safety adherence. When everyone is clear on the regulations and following the protocols, getting out on the water becomes safer and more enjoyable for everyone by reducing the risk of accidents, injuries, and deaths.</p>

            <h3>Required Safety Equipment</h3>
            <p>All vessels are required to have specific safety equipment on board, and the requirements will vary depending on the type of vessel, number of passengers, and more. These include life jackets (Personal Flotation Devices, or PFDs), and boats over 16 feet also need to have a throwable flotation device. Life jackets must be stowed in a way that makes them accessible, and they all must be the right size for the intended wearer. If there are children on your vessel, make sure that you have the right size available for them.</p>

            <p>Other safety equipment includes fire extinguishers, distress signals, air horns, and navigation lights.</p>

            <h3>Boating Under the Influence</h3>
            <p>The legal blood alcohol concentration for adults (over the age of 21) is 0.08%, the same as driving a motor vehicle. Violating these laws can lead to fines, arrest, mandatory courses, and losing your privilege to boat. Both the USCG and FWC do regular patrols and sobriety checkpoints to make sure that people are staying safe on the water when it comes to alcohol and other drugs.</p>

            <h3>Speed Limits</h3>
            <p>There are a number of speed restrictions, including in manatee protection zones, no-wake zones, and minimum wake zones. Violating these limits can lead to a number of penalties, including fines, license suspensions, and more. Know the limits in the waterways you plan to operate in to avoid problems.</p>

            <h3>Other Regulations</h3>
            <p>There are many other regulations you’ll need to consider when it comes to boating in Florida, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Boater Education and Licensing</li>
                <li>Accident reporting</li>
                <li>Anchoring and mooring regulations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It’s your responsibility as a boater to know the regulations and make sure you are complying with them to keep yourself, your passengers, and everyone else on the water safe from avoidable hazards.</p>

            <h2>Commercial Fishing Laws</h2>
            <p>Florida’s marine environments are vibrant and unique, and play a key role in what makes this state unique. The commercial fishing industry relies on the health of these environments through strict monitoring and regulatory efforts that strike a healthy balance between economic success and long-term ecological sustainability. The laws and regulations that govern commercial fisheries in our waters account for the many complexities of these needs. Here is a brief rundown of some of the key aspects of the commercial fishing laws in Florida.</p>

            <h3>Licensing Requirements</h3>
            <p>In order to operate as a commercial fisherman in Florida, there are a number of licenses and permits necessary, many of which depend on the type of species and the volume of fish being targeted. The most common commercial licenses are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Saltwater Products License (SLP): Required for anyone harvesting marine species commercially.</li>
                <li>Restricted Species Endorsement: Applies to species that are restricted due to ecological or economic importance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limits and Quotas</h3>
            <p>Most species have limits and quotas to ensure sustainable harvesting. There are daily bag limits, total allowable catch, and size limits to ensure fish reach reproductive maturity.</p>

            <h3>Seasons</h3>
            <p>Seasons run at set times to allow for reproductive periods to take place without interference.</p>

            <h3>Gear Restrictions</h3>
            <p>There are regulations on which types of gear can be used, when they can be used, and to what extent. Certain types of gear require additional endorsements or licenses.</p>

Florida is a premier destination for recreational watersports, and the state uses its comprehensive laws and regulations to provide clear guidelines on safe and responsible boating. It’s essential that recreational boaters are clear on these laws to stay compliant while ensuring everyone’s safety.</p>

            <h3>Boater Education</h3>
            <p>Boater education is required for anyone born on or after January 1, 1988, to complete a NASBLA-approved course to legally operate a vessel with 10 or more horsepower.</p>

            <h3>Water Sports Regulations</h3>
            <p>Activities like water skiing and wakeboarding are popular, with strict rules including having a dedicated observer on board and using approved life jackets.</p>
