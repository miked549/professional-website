<h1>Understanding Plantar Fasciitis</h1>

<p>If you consider the fact that every time you take a step, there is some minimal impact on your heel, you realize that the bottoms of your feet can take a beating. If you engage in high-impact exercise, it’s very likely that you’ll develop a condition known as plantar fasciitis, which is also referred to as “jogger’s heel,” “policeman’s heel,” or “heel spurs.” Even if you aren’t a runner, however, there’s still a chance you’ll develop this painful condition.</p>

<p>You may be able to alleviate the symptoms by resting and applying ice packs, but many patients require a more proactive approach to deal with plantar fasciitis. This article will discuss the causes, symptoms, and common treatments of plantar fasciitis, and it will introduce you to a highly effective therapy that has been getting patients back on their feet without the pain: chiropractic shockwave therapy.</p>

<h2>What is Plantar Fasciitis?</h2>
<p>The plantar fascia is a thick band of tissue comprised mostly of ligaments that connect your heel to your toes, inside the arch of the foot. Because there are also numerous pain receptors along this area, injuries to the region can be quite painful. Plantar fasciitis is the result of inflammation along parts or all of the plantar fascia.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of Plantar Fasciitis</h2>
<p>One of the most prominent symptoms of plantar fasciitis is a sharp, stabbing pain. This may feel similar to the type of pain one feels when they have a sharp stone in their shoe or sock, which is why the condition is often referred to as “heel spurs.” Other symptoms can include swelling, stiffness, or tenderness. The conditions that lead to heel pain can also be a clue that it’s caused by plantar fasciitis. For instance, many people only experience pain when they first wake up or only during exercise. With plantar fasciitis, the most intense pain is close to the plantar fascia, but it can radiate to other parts of the feet or leg.</p>

<h2>Causes of Plantar Fasciitis</h2>
<p>There are multiple ways that a patient can get plantar fasciitis. Among the more common causes of plantar fasciitis are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Repetitive stress or impacts</li>
    <li>Improperly fitting footwear</li>
    <li>Genetic anomalies that affect the shape of the foot</li>
    <li>Gait abnormalities</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Common is Plantar Fasciitis?</h2>
<p>One in ten people will experience plantar fasciitis at some point in their lifetime. Furthermore, two million Americans are treated for the condition every year with the assumption that there are many more who go untreated. Statistically, plantar fasciitis disproportionately affects women in their 40s to their 60s, overweight individuals, and athletes.</p>

<h2>Traditional Treatments vs. Chiropractic Approaches</h2>
<p>Treatment approaches depend on the severity of the patient’s plantar fasciitis and the background of the attending medical professional. In mild cases, patients may be able to treat their injury with rest and by applying ice at 15-minute intervals throughout the day.</p>

<h3>Traditional Medical Treatments</h3>
<p>A podiatrist treating plantar fasciitis may recommend orthotic devices or inserts that are meant to correct fallen arches. There are also some medical interventions that a doctor may prescribe, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</li>
    <li>Corticosteroid injections</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chiropractic Approaches</h3>
<p>Chiropractors treat the underlying causes of the plantar fasciitis, usually forgoing solutions that only treat the pain. This can include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Massage therapy</li>
    <li>Physical therapy exercises</li>
    <li>Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chiropractic Shockwave Therapy</h2>
<p>Chiropractic shockwave therapy is also referred to as extracorporeal shockwave therapy, or ESWT for short. While ESWT has broad applications, it has been proven to be extremely effective in treating plantar fasciitis, boasting a 95% success rate.</p>

<h3>How it Works</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>The ESWT Machine:</strong> Produces soundwaves that patients can feel on their feet, designed for comfort.</li>
    <li><strong>Target the Affected Area:</strong> Shockwaves penetrate damaged tissue.</li>
    <li><strong>Mechanical Effects:</strong> Increases blood flow, triggers the immune system, and breaks down scar tissue.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Evidence of Efficacy</h2>
<p>Multiple studies have demonstrated the efficacy of ESWT for plantar fasciitis, showing significant improvement in a majority of patients.</p>
